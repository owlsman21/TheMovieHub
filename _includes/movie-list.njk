{#
This file is likely included by index.njk or movies.njk to display a grid of movies.
The error was previously caused by using 'now' (string) instead of now (Date object)
with the htmlDateString filter in the footer if this file contained a full layout.
However, if this is a partial, it's more likely the error came from the
file *including* this partial (e.g., index.njk or about.njk)
that then used the filter.
Assuming this file is solely for the movie card generation and the "Loading latest movies" text.
The `htmlDateString` filter error was traced to this file or `about.njk` which might include this.
Given your feedback, the `_includes/base.njk` provided earlier was actually
the content of `_includes/movie-list.njk` or a similar layout.
I'm reconstructing this based on that.
#}

<div class="container"> {# Assuming this partial still needs a container around the movie list #}
    <section class="latest-movies-section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Latest Movies</h2>
        <div id="latest-movie-grid" class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-5 gap-6">
            <p class="col-span-full text-center">Loading latest movies...</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    {# This section below is from the previous file content you provided that used the `htmlDateString` filter incorrectly.
       If this `movie-list.njk` is meant to be a full page layout, then the footer belongs here.
       If it's *only* a partial for the movie grid, this footer content should be in `index.njk` (or a `base.njk` layout).
       Given the error, it seems this template *was* acting as a main layout or included code with a footer.
       I'm putting it here as you provided the code for it previously.
    #}
    <footer class="main-footer">
        <div class="container">
            {# FIX: Pass a real Date object to htmlDateString filter #}
            <p>&copy; {{ now | htmlDateString | slice(0, 4) }} The Movie Hub</p>
            <div class="footer-links">
                <a href="#">Privacy Policy</a>
                <a href="#">Terms of Service</a>
            </div>
        </div>
    </footer>
</div>

{# IMPORTANT: Script tags belong at the end of the <body> in your main HTML file (like index.njk), not typically in an _include unless that include *is* the entire body.
   However, if this `_includes/movie-list.njk` is what `index.njk` is largely built upon, they might have been here.
   I'm including them here for completeness based on the code you've been working with, but confirm they are loading correctly.
   If `index.njk` also has these, you might have duplicates. The best practice is to have them once in your main layout file (`index.njk` or a common `base.njk`).
